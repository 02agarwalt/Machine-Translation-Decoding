the selection committee can show some impact . 
the work that over the next two years of strikes a senator . 
it is a committee on these important to determine what principle , as some new Senate committee sit senators . 
i am therefore in the sitting of the committee to realize that one of the Senate report was yesterday ' s new indeed . 
it was sent a replacement . 
it is one name Senate and honourable . 
therefore I am , that it cannot see you nice ? 
the Senate will have to find in their own research was that without . 
when one , it must accept the do a job . 
the women who are sitting in the Senate have proven . 
they have much more that the majority of them in the Senate . men remplissaient
